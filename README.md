# JavaCalculator
This is a calculator project written in Java that I did awhile back.

Features:
- Handles input from both the GUI buttons and users keyboard.
- Follows the PEMDAS order of operations
- sin(x) is currently the only function/button not implemented
- Has a session log where you can see all evaluations
- Can export the session log if you want to save it.

The GUI is written using JavaSwing as this was my first GUI.

To use the program:
- You need to have Java installed
- Locate and launch the file "StartApplication.java".
